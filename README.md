Abstract:

The germinal center response (GCR) represents a hallmark event of adaptive humoral immunity, culminating in the formation of memory B cells and high-affinity antibody-secreting plasma cells. Unfolding in the primary follicles of the secondary lymph organs, GCR involves cell-to-cell interactions between B cells, follicular dendritic cells (FDC), and T follicular helper cells (Tfh), featuring complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Underpinning these cellular dynamics are intracellular signal transduction and gene networks that respond to cell surface molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. As our knowledge on GCR continues to expand, mathematical modeling has become an indispensable tool to help disentangle the intricacy of GCR and attain novel mechanistic insights. While GC has been modeled with different levels of granularities, to date a cross-scale simulation framework, integrating molecular, cellular, and tissue-level responses is still lacking. Here we report our recent progress toward this end by showing a hybrid agent-based model constructed on the CompuCell3D platform. Tellurium is used to simulate the intracellular gene network comprising NF-kB, FOXO1, MYC, AP4, BLIMP1, etc. that respond to B cell receptor (BCR) and CD40 signaling. The outputs of the molecular network drive the spatiotemporal behaviors of the B cells, including chemotaxis between the dark zone (DZ) and light zone (LZ), multiple rounds of growth and mitotic proliferation burst, BCR affinity alteration due to somatic hypermutation, apoptosis induced by damaging mutations in DZ, positive selection and apoptosis in LZ, and emergence of plasma cells. Our simulations are able to recapitulate key molecular, functional, and morphological events of GCR including population growth, affinity maturation, and clonal expansion. The modeling framework developed here provides a customizable multiscale simulation platform to enable in silico investigations of a range of GC features quantitatively, including population turnover, BCR mutation rate, death timer, burst size, availability of Tfh cells, and effects of genetic and chemical perturbations.
